What is important to you?

Time is important to me. 

5 Reasons why it is important to me:
1. Everything is bound to time.
2. Time is the most precious resource because you can't get it back.
3. No one knows how much time they have.
4. Managing time poorly or well has a huge impact on life.
5. Skills are impacted by how much time one invests in them.

Below are some pictures I found on google in my free TIME. :joy:
