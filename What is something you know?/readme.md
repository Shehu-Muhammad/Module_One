What is something I know?

I know how to make pancakes.

Step 1: Gather Ingredients
Ingredients: 
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla (optional)

Yield: 8 Pancakes

Step 2: Combine the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Step 3: Add the eggs, vanilla, and vegetable oil. Whisk the batter 
thoroughly until there are no more lumps.
Step 4: Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Coat with a non-stick 
cooking spray, butter, or vegetable oil to prevent sticking.
Step 5: Spoon the batter onto the pan and cook each side until it is 
golden brown. Use a spatula to flip the pancakes and to remove them when 
they are finished. 
Step 6: Serve immediately. Add fruit, maple syrup, whipped cream, or 
powdered sugar if desired.

Enjoy!
